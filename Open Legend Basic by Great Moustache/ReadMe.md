* Added "Equipment" section to sheet
	- 20 items used in Open Legend with checkmarks next to each if the item is bulky or heavy

* Updated calls to Attributes for updating the total Cost Spent
    - Found error in updating before the cost value was set, so it was displaying the previous Total instead of the current.

### 0.5.5
* Updated worker scripts to be more function based, and "onload" to run all calculations
    - To help with future changes, so sheets will update values
* Changed Roll buttons so the "value" field is figured out in Javascript

### Plans & Info

## Plans
* Fix Top info section of sheet to compress when page is shrunk
* Make Action rolls calculate their own string for Rolls
	+Have a spot for advantage/disadvantage that is permanent to that action roll
* Make a settings section for each Attribute
	+ For the physical: drop down menu for attribute subsitution
	+ For might, checkbox on whether attribute subsitution affects heavy carry
	+ For all, an option to increase or decrease dice size above/below what the attribute score would normally allow
	+ Option to Keep Highest/Lowest of d20 (based on certain feats)
[done 2016 Nov 19] * Have fields for adjusting the Hit Point total for feats and other
	[done 2016 Nov 19] + Have "Fortitude, Presence, & Will" listed below Hit Points so people know which attributes affect Hit Points
[done]* Make Inventory Section
[done]* Include more fields for Feats, Perks, & Flaws
	[done]+ Plus ability to click to roll them so all can see info about
[done]* Include Inventory into speed (how it affects)
[done]* Creation of a "fancy (advanced)" version of the sheet
	+ More optimization for web (and potentially mobile)
	+ Sections that disappear with a click
* A settings section where you could modify certain values
	+ For "homebrew" and if changes come up before final release of product
* A rolltemplete that isn't using the default
	+ Adding in a pop-up for target CR to caculate and do the math if you hit & damage
* Clean up the CSS code
	- Currently includes a lot from a previous sheet I was using, some code doesn't apply

## Info
* Javascript is employed to auto calculate nearly every field
	+ Dice are determined based on Attribute values
		- Needs to be fixed if values higher than 9 are entered
	+ Hit Points are auto calculated
	+ Total points spent on Attributes calculate
	+ Evasion, Toughness, & Resolve auot calculated
	+ Feat & Attribute points auto calculated based on XP
	+ Level determined based on XP
		- Needs to have something to indicate max value for Attributes based on level

* This basic version was designed to aesthetically look like the Charactersheet provided by Open Legends
	+ Certain design designed are done based on this, only planning to add a few things like inventory
	+ The Advanced version (in developement) will have more robust use to it
	+ Created this because notes indicate the Roll20 Charactersheet is in the "icebox" by developers at the moment.
		- If they put out one, may stop working on this and use theirs, or just focus on advanced version.
